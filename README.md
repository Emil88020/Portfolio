# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi there! I'm **Kacper**, a passionate programmer with over **12 years** of (non-commercial)experience in the tech world. I started exploring technology at a very young age — I was **3 or 4 years old** when I first began using computers. By the age of **8**, I had already developed a strong curiosity about how games and software are created, which led me to dive into programming.

My journey began with **C#**, and to this day, I feel most at home working with it, particularly within the **.NET** framework. However, my knowledge extends far beyond just C#, as I love learning new languages and exploring different areas of programming (just started working as a programmer commercially).

Here are the programming languages I’m proficient in: 
-
| | | 
|--------------|--------------| 
| TypeScript | JavaScript |
 | C++ | C | 
 | C# | Java |
 | PHP | SQL |
 | Dart | Python|
